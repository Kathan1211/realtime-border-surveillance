# realtime-border-surveillance
This project is a real-time object detection system built using YOLOv11, designed specifically for aerial surveillance and border security applications. It allows users to upload aerial images or video footage, define a Region of Interest (ROI), and automatically detect critical objects such as humans, cars, trucks, drones, airplanes, and other large or small vehicles. The system features a clean and interactive Streamlit web interface and uses a Flask API backend to connect with the detection model. Users can customize the ROI coordinates (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax) to monitor only specific areas, reducing false positives and focusing detection on restricted or high-risk zones. With a confidence threshold filtering and model fine-tuned on aerial datasets (COCO + DOTA), the system achieves high accuracy (~94.3%) and low latency (~200ms/frame), making it suitable for real-time monitoring, smart alert generation, and security automation.
